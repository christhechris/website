Chris Betters is a Postdoctoral Fellow with the ARC Centre for CubeSats, UAVs their applications working the in the Sydney Astrophotonic Instrumenation Laboratories. His research focuses on the development (design, construction, characterisation, and implementation) of cutting-edge compact optical instruments that harness the latest photonic technologies, originally for astronomical applications. More recently, I have been using techniques and methods I developed for astronomy to tackle a broader range of problems in academia and industry, specifically in remote earth observation and agriculture.
